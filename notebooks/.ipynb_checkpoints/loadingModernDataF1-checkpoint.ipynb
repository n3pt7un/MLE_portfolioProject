    "Introduction\n",
    "Formula 1 is a data-driven sport where the outcome of a race depends on a combination of driver skill, team strategy, car performance, and external factors such as weather and track characteristics. With access to rich datasets, such as telemetry, lap times, and historical results, it is possible to leverage machine learning techniques to predict race outcomes. This project aims to explore and model the complex interplay of these factors to gain insights into what influences driver performance and race results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting Formula 1 race outcomes, specifically the finishing positions of drivers, based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualifying session data (grid position, sector times, tire compounds).\n",
    "Historical performance of drivers and teams at specific tracks.\n",
    "Weather conditions and track-specific characteristics.\n",
    "Team-level metrics, such as reliability and average performance.\n",
    "This model will provide a data-driven approach to understanding and predicting race results, offering valuable insights for analysts, fans, and potentially teams themselves."
